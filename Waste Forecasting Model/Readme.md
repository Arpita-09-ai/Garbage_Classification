# Predict daily waste volume and optimize collection schedules and resources using LSTM.

## Overview

This project predicts daily municipal waste for multiple cities using an LSTM neural network and calculates the required trucks, staff, and drivers for collection. The system includes preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

**Features**

Load and preprocess historical waste data

Feature engineering & label encoding

Normalize data and create sequences for LSTM

Train-test split and LSTM model training

Predict future waste volumes

Optimize waste collection schedules

Allocate resources (trucks, staff, drivers)

Visualize predictions and resource allocation

Save/load trained model for deployment
