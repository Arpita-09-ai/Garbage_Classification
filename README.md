## 🧭 Why This Project?

Every piece of garbage matters.  
Improper sorting leads to overflowing landfills and wasted recyclables.  
This project brings **machine learning** to the front lines of sustainability, helping automate and **simplify waste classification**.

🧠 Built during the **Shell-Edunet Skills4Future Internship (June–July 2025)**.

## 🔍 What Can It Detect?

The AI model classifies any uploaded garbage image into:

| Category   | Example Items               |
|------------|-----------------------------|
| 🟫 Cardboard | Boxes, cartons               |
| 🟡 Plastic   | Bottles, containers          |
| 📰 Paper     | Newspapers, wrappers         |
| 🔩 Metal     | Cans, utensils               |
| 🟢 Glass     | Jars, shattered pieces       |
| 🗑️ Trash     | Everything else non-recyclable |
